Category Selector
==================

This TYPO3 extension provides a generic category selector for lists of objects that are based on extbase/fluid and sys_category.
You can display a configurable category tree with object count and use it for filtering a given list of objects. The category
selector can be used with your own extbase extension or any third party extension from TER.

Check out the manual at: http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/category_selector/
