/*
One underlying problem with extbase and sys_category should be mentioned: extbase currently
ignores TCA's MM_match_fields option in repository queries. This means that sys_category
can only be used with extbase if a single table makes use of the categorization. As soon as
sys_category is used for more than one table DB queries will yield strange results and wrong
record counts. Check out this links for more information:

The category selector solves this by overriding the problematic method in Typo3DbBackend with a patch.
For now I could only solve this with a global directive. It should not lead to any side effects, but
nevertheless it would be better to just do it for the category selector plugin instance. Per plugin override
of extbase classes should be possible from 6.1 onwards, but what's the correct TypoScript notation?
